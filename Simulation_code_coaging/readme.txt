1- Networks should be build using 'network_build.py' script. 
2- 'co-aging_nets.py' simulates aging using the networks and saves the data. 
3- 'mortality_plot.py' plots mortality curve using the data.

Notes:

Be careful to use same number of nodes in the 'co-aging_nets.py' with 'network_build.py'

It is easiest to use anaconda environment to download 'graph-tool' library. I suggest creating a new conda environment and downloading it there following the steps given in https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool/-/wikis/installation-instructions
